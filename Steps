The steps involved are:
1. Take 2 Prototyping boards one for transmitter and one for the receiver give the correct connections according to the circuit diagrams
   given in TX1080.jpg and RX1080.jpg.
2. Once the circuits are built use a prebuilt car chasis or make a car chasis on your own using your creativity.
3. Once the chasis is built attach the wheels to the chasis and give the motor connections of the wheels to the receiver circuit.
4. Connect the batteries to both the transmitter and receiver.
5. Make sure you hold the transmitter in your hand.
6. Switch on the TX and RX and once you move the transmitter in your hand the car moves in the respective direction.
7. You can make changes to the code and add more features other than front, back, left and right movements.
